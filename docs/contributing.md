## Issues

We use [Linear](https://linear.app/ystv) to track issues - to access it, sign in with your @ystv.co.uk Google account (ask a Computing Team member if you don't have one).

File an issue for any significant change you plan to make, particularly if it was requested by someone outside of Computing Team (in this case, please add the `User Feedback` label).

If you're planning to work on something, please assign it to yourself on Linear. If you need to stop work, or you find it's too complicated, un-assign it (and leave a comment summarising your progress so far).

Feel free to assign any un-assigned issue to yourself, you don't need to ask anyone. But if the issue is assigned to someone else, ask them before you start work on it.

## Branch Names

Branches created for Linear issues should use the branch name [provided by linear](https://linear.app/docs/github#link-using-pull-requests) which follow the format `int-<issue id>-<issue title>`. Branches unrelated to a filed issue should be in the format `<initials or first name>/<feature or fix being implemented>`, for example `mia/fix-main-again`.

## Commits

Commit messages can contain a related [Linear issue ID](https://linear.app/docs/github#link-using-commits) (in the format `[INT-\<ID>]`) at the beginning to help Linear track issue progress, however this is not enforced or widely used.

## Pull requests

Pull requests related to an issue should contain the [Linear issue ID](https://linear.app/docs/github#link-using-pull-requests) and either the issue title, or a summary of what was done to close the issue. For example: `[INT-67] Add Dark Mode`. This helps Linear to track what stage the issue is in and should be followed for all issues where applicable.

Pull requests should use the provided [Pull Request Template](/.github/pull_request_template.md). This includes sections for what you've done, why you've done it, and how you've done it, along with how you tested it and some screenshots if applicable.
