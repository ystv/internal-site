## Issues

We use [Linear](https://linear.app/ystv) to track issues - to access it, sign in with your @ystv.co.uk Google account (ask a Computing Team member if you don't have one).

## Branch Names

Branches created for Linear issues should use the branch name [provided by linear](https://linear.app/docs/github#link-using-pull-requests) which follow the format `int-<issue id>-<issue title>`. Branches unrelated to a filed issue should be in the format `<initials or first name>/<feature or fix being implemented>`, for example `mia/fix-main-again`.

## Commits

Commit messages can contain a related [Linear issue ID](https://linear.app/docs/github#link-using-commits) (in the format `[INT-\<ID>]`) at the beginning to help Linear track issue progress, however this is not enforced or widely used.

## Pull requests

Pull requests related to an issue should contain the [Linear issue ID](https://linear.app/docs/github#link-using-pull-requests) and either the issue title, or a summary of what was done to close the issue. For example: `[INT-67] Add Dark Mode`. This helps Linear to track what stage the issue is in and should be followed for all issues where applicable.
